          what we do here at this website is to provide funny memes at no cost to the viewer. We also provide a slight peek into thw world of paintball and mountain biking.
          </p>  Mountain biking is exhilarating sport, where the rider can go at their own pace, be it fast or slow and still have a lot of fun. Although they are mildly expensive, they are worth the cost and easy to maintain. Mountain bikes can also be ridden in almost any trail or mountain anywhere, as they are made to ride well in almost any conditions and enviroment. For new riders, getting the hang of switching gears might be challenging at first, one the person learns the combinations, they can have immense amounts of fun up on the mountain. Many different manufactuers make their own vision of a mountain bike in terms of frame and seat, so make sure to always try and physically test the mountin bike before you buy it to get your perfect fit. Mountain biking is an amazing sport that attratcs alot of people and already has millions of riders devoted to it.

            <p>Paintball is a very broad sport that has many different versions that all appeal to different people. One type of paintball "mode" is woodsball/ scenario. In scenarios, players are taken to war- torn mock battlefields and split into two teams. When the whistle is blown, each side's goal is to gain an advantage in ground and try to eliminate the other side. Capture the flag is also a popular gamemode where a flag placed into the center of the battlefield and the goal is to get the flag to the enemy's side. Speedball is the higher paced version of woodsball where smaller, faster shooting, and very high-tech and expensive guns are used. Teams are usually 5-6 members where each teammate has their specific job againy the enemy. The fields are usually turf and air inflated obstsacles that players can use for cover. If all of that seems overwhelming, you can rest easy knowing that most paintball parks have different skill levels at which people can play, and limits to what kind of gun is used and how fast it can fire. Parks also rent out lower caliber guns (.50 caliber as opposed to the normal .68 caliber paintbsall) that dont hit as hard and are for the younger players or older people who dont want bruise marks. Paintball is a very fun extreme sport that everyoe should try at least one in their life because the fast pace of every game is addicting to anyone and everyone who regularly plays now.
